This code was created on Google Colab. To run:

1. Upload the Google Colab folder to your Gdrive.
2. Navigate to and open the "Next_Event_Prediction" .ipynb file
3. Run each cell in order and follow the file linking and parameter setting instructions.

The file is currently set to run on the Helpdesk data with a BiLSTMAtt in the 
transfer learning cell. After successful running you will see files in the 
"training" and "results" folder with MAE values for each epoch and trace group. 

A version of the Next_Event_Prediction colab folder is provided in python 
scripts for your convenience to view, as the "Next_Event_Prediction" colab file 
can sometimes cause Gitlab to crash when trying to open. The cell separations 
in Colab are represented by a row of '#'. I recommend not running the python 
scripts on your local machine as there will be significant changes required to 
get it to work.
